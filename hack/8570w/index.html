        <p>Welcome to this page! This page is work in progress, but welcome.</p>
        <p>This page is about hackintoshing the 8570W.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, you can ask me in the issues page.</p>
        
        <h2>History about the EFI</h2>
        <p>There is already a history in German by <a href="https://github.com/TECHNIKVERBOT">@TECHNIKVERBOT</a> which you can find <a href="https://technikverbot.github.io/html/8570W.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>But here is a quick TL;DR in English:</p>
        <p>- Our tester (<a href="https://github.com/HansHuberHass">@HansHubertHass</a>) wanted to try Hackintosh <br>
           - We tried to download an EFI from a Chinese website which failed <br>
           - We made a Clover EFI which failed to boot macOS <br>
           - Initally OpenCore EFI on 31.05.2020 with many broken features <br>
           - After many try-and-errors the EFI got stable, except: <br>
                - Sleep <br>
                - Brightness control <br>
                - Battery readout <br>
           - EFI got a break after deciding to uninstall macOS and go back to Windows <br>
           - After @TECHNIKVERBOT telling our tester to buy an external enclosure to make EFI even better <br>
           => OpenCore 0.6.6 will be released</p>
        
        <h2>How to improve the Hackintosh experience</h2>
        <p>The EFI I provided is still not completed, in my opinion. Yes, it is usable for daily usage, but the EFI can be improved. The changes I did does not suit for every system, so the patches have to be done by yourself. Here are some examples:</p>
        
        <h3>AirportItlwm</h3>
        <p>This kext will allow connecting to the internet with an Intel WiFi card. The kext is very stable, but I still do not find it "finished". So, I will not include it in my EFI. Another reason is, the boot time gets longer, which is not ideal. Not to mention, for users who have another WiFi card, will also experience issues due to the "not finished" kext. But, if you want to try the kext anyways which can be found <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm">here</a>, I suggest downloading <a href="https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree">ProperTree</a> and add the kext to the 'config.plist'.</p>
        
        <h3>Language</h3>
        <p>This is a little OCD thing, but changing the language to your language is recommended. The current default language is English. This is the <a href="https://github.com/SkyrilHD/HP-8570W-Hackintosh/blob/4d0b7d784bf224b90dd3d0e639626845f6188457/EFI/OC/config.plist#L1015">line</a> you need to change. The list of languages can be found <a href="https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Utilities/AppleKeyboardLayouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt">here</a>.</p>
