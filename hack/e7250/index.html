        <p>Welcome to this page! This page is work in progress, but welcome.</p>
        <p>This page is about hackintoshing the E7250.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, you can ask me in the issues page.</p>
        
        <h2>History about the EFI</h2>
        <p>This EFI was made because, when I got my laptop, it just felt wrong. I was using the 2006 MacBook 13" as my daily driver (as a portable device, I have an iMac 2012 which can only stay in one place). Well, since it is an old device which only runs Snow Leopard it was time to replace my daily driver with a newer one. But the newer MacBooks have so many issues, so I thought about buying a Windows laptop. I got the E7250 and meanwhile using Windows I missed my Pro Apps which I was working with them outside of my house. So, I thought about returning to the Hackintosh scene and create an EFI. So, I created this repo after making a semi-successful EFI which I wanted to share. Here we are, now we are running Big Sur with our machine flawlessly. There is also a nice transition from "throw everything in and hope everything works" to "this is broken? Here is the fix". Mainly, since Hackintoshing changed so much in the past few years, I even had to learn again how hackintoshing works. So, the beginning was a mess which is visible in the 10.14 branch. Coming to the 10.15 branch, you see a lot of improvements that took place after learning how everything works. I initially wanted to convert to OpenCore 0.5.7 but, I couldn't do it because the changes between Clover and OpenCore are really big. So, the OpenCore conversion had its brake as I had to learn how OpenCore works. Reading the manual and Dortania's guide, I was able to quickly learn how OpenCore works. Then, the OpenCore conversion began. Since OpenCore is very sensitive about the config, I decided to upload the OpenCore 0.5.7 EFI, so I had a backup for myself. And since then, I tried improving the user experience, which was easier said than done. I pretty much fixed most of the issues and the only issue that kept me releasing the complete EFI was the sleep bug which was a really annoying one. The issue is when you plug a USB device or the AC charger in, sleep becomes to be broken. But without any device plugged in, it works just fine. That was really weird as according to the logs, I had a "lid" problem. So, I thought the laptop was shorted which caused this issue. But reading Dortania's guide on how to fix sleep, I thought I fixed it by remapping the USB ports. Well, it didn't. So, the EFI was delayed again until OpenCore 0.6.0 was released. This time I took a different route and read Dortania's guide once again. So, I try-and-errored through the guide, and it turns out a simple GPRW patch was needed. After fixing the annoying issue, the EFI got released the day after. The only small issue it had though was the F11 and F12 brightness keys which there was a workaround with Karabiner Elements. So, the time goes by, and I was ready for Big Sur. Four days, after Big Sur got initially released, I managed to boot Big Sur on my E7250, which I was very proud of. And everything worked beside the F11/F12 issue :P. With caution and behind the scene, I completed my OpenCore 0.6.0/0.6.1 EFI in a different branch which is now deleted and perfected the EFI for Big Sur. Again, the time goes by, and when OpenCore 0.6.2 was released, I made a clean EFI which has no other debugging crap on it and posted every single change I did on GitHub. But I know myself, I knew an F11/F12 issue cannot beat me. So, I tried nearly every SSDT patches to fix the damn issue. I thought finally including the ACOS_ACSE SSDT fixed the issue since it really did fix it. On OpenCore 0.6.3 release, I updated the current EFI and the kexts which were critical for later beta and stable releases of Big Sur. And that is where the story nearly ends. The EFI was completed, stable and running fast. But wait, the F11/F12 brightness issue is still there. So, I added a BRT6 patch and SSDT which was the fix I waited for so long. After fixing this issue, I completed the EFI. Damn. The history of this EFI is really big. But in the end, the EFI is completed, has no issues and works very well. Now I love my E7250 even more.</p>
        
        <h2>How to improve the Hackintosh experience</h2>
        <p>The EFI I provided is still not completed, in my opinion. Yes, it is usable for daily usage, but the EFI can be improved. The changes I did does not suit for every system, so the patches have to be done by yourself. Here are some examples:</p>
        
        <h3>Airportitlwm</h3>
        <p>This kext will allow connecting to the internet with an Intel WiFi card. The kext is very stable, but I still do not find it "finished". So, I will not include it in my EFI. Another reason is, the boot time gets longer, which is not ideal. Not to mention, for users who have another WiFi card, will also experience issues due to the "not finished" kext. But, if you want to try the kext anyways which can be found <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm">here</a>, I suggest downloading <a href="https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree">ProperTree</a> and add the kext to the 'config.plist'.</p><br>
        <p>Starting with v2.3, I will include AirportItlwm in my EFI. But it is disabled like IntelBluetooth. If you want to use them, open the config and enable IntelBluetoothFirmware, IntelBluetoothInjector and AirportItlwm.</p>
        
        <h3>SMBIOS</h3>
        <p>This EFI has already the SMBIOS included. But, since it is a pre-made EFI, I suggest changing the serial number, so people who will use the EFI do not have the same serial number/board number which can be blocked too. Using <a href="https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS">GenSMBIOS</a> will create a serial number and replace the numbers in the 'config.plist' which can be found under <a href="https://github.com/SkyrilHD/Dell-E7250-Hackintosh/commit/888de32de49129d9cb64e458f03746fe9dcd0443">PlatformInfo > Generic</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>Language</h3>
        <p>This is a little OCD thing, but changing the language to your language is recommended. The current default language is English. This is the <a href="https://github.com/SkyrilHD/Dell-E7250-Hackintosh/commit/c6411621eb50c44abf7300094b6a2722e759bfe3#diff-c2ed8d4b6d5b0bee355f88d887ffc834d4bfec0042ac54086b2fe2b74175d4ff">line</a> you need to change. The list of languages can be found <a href="https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Utilities/AppleKeyboardLayouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt">here</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>CPUFriend</h3>
        <p>This additional kext does dynamic power management data injection which allows to achieve Apple-like power management and CPU-Speedstepping. I noticed my battery life was improved too.</p>
        
        <h3>Fastboot</h3>
        <p>The EFI shows the picker at every boot which is a waste of time if you need to do your work quickly. You can disable the Picker by changing 'ShowPicker' to false in config.plist (which can found under Misc>Boot). The boot-chime is still activated. Accessing to the Picker is a hit-and-miss for me. According to the documents, you can enter to the Picker menu if you hold 'Option' key.</p>
        
        <h3>Touchscreen</h3>
        <p>For those who have the touchscreen model, you try using your touch, too! You just have to enable VoodooI2C-related kexts which are VoodooGPIO.kext, VoodooI2CServices.kext, VoodooInput.kext, VoodooI2C.kext and VoodooI2CHID.kext.</p><br>
        <p>This is a feature, I did not and cannot try because I own the 768p model.</p>
