        <h2>History about the EFI</h2>
        <p>This EFI was made because, when I got my laptop, it just felt wrong. I was using the 2006 MacBook 13" as my daily driver (as a portable device, I have an iMac 2012 which can only stay in one place). Well, since it is an old device which only runs Snow Leopard it was time to replace my daily driver with a newer one. But the newer MacBooks have so many issues, so I thought about buying a Windows laptop. I got the E7250 and meanwhile using Windows I missed my Pro Apps which I was working with them outside of my house. So, I thought about returning to the Hackintosh scene and create an EFI. So, I created this repo after making a semi-successful EFI which I wanted to share. Here we are, now we are running Big Sur with our machine flawlessly. There is also a nice transition from "throw everything in and hope everything works" to "this is broken? Here is the fix". Mainly, since Hackintoshing changed so much in the past few years, I even had to learn again how hackintoshing works. So, the beginning was a mess which is visible in the 10.14 branch. Coming to the 10.15 branch, you see a lot of improvements that took place after learning how everything works. I initially wanted to convert to OpenCore 0.5.7 but, I couldn't do it because the changes between Clover and OpenCore are really big. So, the OpenCore conversion had its brake as I had to learn how OpenCore works. Reading the manual and Dortania's guide, I was able to quickly learn how OpenCore works. Then, the OpenCore conversion began. Since OpenCore is very sensitive about the config, I decided to upload the OpenCore 0.5.7 EFI, so I had a backup for myself. And since then, I tried improving the user experience, which was easier said than done. I pretty much fixed most of the issues and the only issue that kept me releasing the complete EFI was the sleep bug which was a really annoying one. The issue is when you plug a USB device or the AC charger in, sleep becomes to be broken. But without any device plugged in, it works just fine. That was really weird as according to the logs, I had a "lid" problem. So, I thought the laptop was shorted which caused this issue. But reading Dortania's guide on how to fix sleep, I thought I fixed it by remapping the USB ports. Well, it didn't. So, the EFI was delayed again until OpenCore 0.6.0 was released. This time I took a different route and read Dortania's guide once again. So, I try-and-errored through the guide, and it turns out a simple GPRW patch was needed. After fixing the annoying issue, the EFI got released the day after. The only small issue it had though was the F11 and F12 brightness keys which there was a workaround with Karabiner Elements. So, the time goes by, and I was ready for Big Sur. Four days, after Big Sur got initially released, I managed to boot Big Sur on my E7250, which I was very proud of. And everything worked beside the F11/F12 issue :P. With caution and behind the scene, I completed my OpenCore 0.6.0/0.6.1 EFI in a different branch which is now deleted and perfected the EFI for Big Sur. Again, the time goes by, and when OpenCore 0.6.2 was released, I made a clean EFI which has no other debugging crap on it and posted every single change I did on GitHub. But I know myself, I knew an F11/F12 issue cannot beat me. So, I tried nearly every SSDT patches to fix the damn issue. I thought finally including the ACOS_ACSE SSDT fixed the issue since it really did fix it. On OpenCore 0.6.3 release, I updated the current EFI and the kexts which were critical for later beta and stable releases of Big Sur. And that is where the story nearly ends. The EFI was completed, stable and running fast. But wait, the F11/F12 brightness issue is still there. So, I added a BRT6 patch and SSDT which was the fix I waited for so long. After fixing this issue, I completed the EFI. Damn. The history of this EFI is really big. But in the end, the EFI is completed, has no issues and works very well. Now I love my E7250 even more.</p>
